The original dropbox link does not have the new Revealer paper mutation and copy number calls. I recommend at this 
point using these new calls since in the original gcmData.mat file from the original dropbox link, 
there are about 30 cell lines without any mutation calls, meaning that those cell lines  -- which certainly
have mutations -- did not get the muitation calls and so we have some missing data that is coded as 0s instead of missing.

Anyhow, here is the link to the new gcmData2.mat file [which still has the old mutations because we do have data for almost 
all of the 498 cell lines, just not quite all]:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/jw98gzc4g56keup/gcmData2.mat?dl=0


Mutations and copy number modifications are in gcmData.mutcnvaluesRevealer
and mutation/copy number names are in gcmData.mutcnRevealerNames
Note these names end with for example _MUT which means they are calling a mutation,
or e.g. _DEL for a gene deletion.
